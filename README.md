# PDI Ruby Step Plugin

## Building

From the main directory, run `mvn clean package site`.

For the Step, a plugin zip file will be generated that can be unzipped into a PDI Client for testing.  Reports are also generated, covering topics such as unit test results, code coverage statistics, and adherence to code style rules.

The examples provided in the embedded module can be run directly from a Java IDE or command-line.
